/** 

When possible each component should be defined in its own dedicated file (SFC)
Single File components should be named in PascalCase
Base components should all start with the same prefix (like Base or App)
You can think of base components as your app-wide reusable components like a button or a modal
This groups them together and declares their global, reusable nature
Component names should always be multi-worded to not conflict with any existing or future HTML elements. Don't create a Table or a Button component.
Single instance components should begin with the prefix The
For example a site header or footer
This groups them together and declares them as single use
Tightly coupled child components should be prefixed with their parent component's name
